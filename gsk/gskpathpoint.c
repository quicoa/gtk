/**
 * GskPathPoint:
 *
 * `GskPathPoint` is an opaque type representing a point on a path.
 *
 * It can be queried for properties of the path at that point, such as its
 * tangent or its curvature.
 *
 * To obtain a `GskPathPoint`, use [method@Gsk.Path.get_closest_point]
 * or [method@Gsk.PathMeasure.get_point].
 *
 * Note that `GskPathPoint` structs are meant to be stack-allocated, and
 * don't a reference to the path object they are obtained from. It is the
 * callers responsibility to keep a reference to the path as long as the
 * `GskPathPoint` is used.
